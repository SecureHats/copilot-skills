# Microsoft Copilot for Security

## Lesson 3 (DRAFT)

>- NOTE: This next lesson is still in development.

In the 2nd lesson, we learned the fundamentals of making a OpenAPI Specification (swagger) for Microsoft Security Copilot.  
We have created our own OpenAPI Specification that is used to query a public API containing intel on Harry Potter.  
<br>
In the next lesson we will take a look into the difference between the `Security Copilot plugin` and the `OpenAI plugin`.  
At the end of this lesson you wil be able to explain the difference and you will be able to create both plugin types.
